        "In this notebook, you will learn AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a classification algorithm; AdaBoost is actually part of a family of Boosting algorithms. Like Bagging and Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost combines the outputs of many classifiers into an ensemble, but there are some differences. In both Bagging and RF, each classifier in the ensemble is powerful but prone to overfitting. As Bagging or RF aggregate more and more classifiers, they reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "With AdaBoost, each Classifier usually has performance slightly better than random. This is referred to as a weak learner or weak classifier. AdaBoost combines these classifiers to get a strong classifier. Unlike Bagging and Random Forest, in AdaBoost, adding more learners can cause overfitting. As a result, AdaBoost requires Hyperparameter tuning, taking more time to train. One advantage of AdaBoost is that each classifier is smaller, so predictions are faster.\n"

        "In AdaBoost, the strong classifier $H(x)$ is a linear combination of $T$ weak classifiers $h_t(x)$ and $\\alpha_t$ as shown in (1). Although each classifier $h_t(x)$ appears independent, the $\\alpha_t$ contains information about the error of classifiers from $h_1(x),.., h_{t-1}(x)$. As we add more classifiers, the training accuracy gets larger. What’s not so apparent in (1) is that during the training process, the values of that training sample are modified for $h_t(x)$.

        "\n",
        "We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically, it is less expensive to keep customers than to acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.\n",

        "This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.\n",

        "The dataset includes information about:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn\n",
        "*   Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies\n",
        "*   Customer account information – how long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\n",
        "*   Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents\n"
